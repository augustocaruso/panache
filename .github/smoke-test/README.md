# Smoke-test repositories

The [smoke-test workflow](../workflows/smoke-test.yml) builds Panache and runs
`scan.py` against the repositories in `repositories.toml`. The scanner checks
tracked `.md`, `.qmd`, and `.Rmd` files for losslessness and idempotency.

Add a repository with GitHub's `owner/repo` shorthand or a full HTTPS clone URL:

```toml
[[repositories]]
repo = "gohugoio/hugoDocs"
fallback-config = "configs/hugo.toml"
```

`fallback-config` is optional and defaults to `configs/default.toml`, which uses
Panache's built-in defaults. Paths are relative to the manifest. Keep fallback
files and any configs they extend in `configs/`, and use relative `extend` paths
so the files remain usable after downloading the artifact.

## Configuration precedence

The scanner sets `PANACHE_CONFIG` to the selected fallback's absolute path.
Panache first discovers the nearest upstream `.panache.toml`, `panache.toml`, or
`.config/panache.toml`, including configs in subdirectories. An upstream config
replaces the fallback completely; the two are not merged. Normal file-extension
inference still applies, so `.qmd` and `.Rmd` retain their respective flavors.

If an upstream config fails to parse, the scanner retries that file with
`--config` pointing to the same repository fallback. This preserves the existing
handling of obsolete upstream settings: a failure becomes a regression record
only if it also occurs with a valid config.

The shared fallbacks use ordinary Panache configuration:

  | Config             | Behavior when no upstream config exists                                       |
  | ---                | ---                                                                           |
  | `default.toml`     | Built-in defaults.                                                            |
  | `github-docs.toml` | GFM for conventional GitHub documentation paths; built-in defaults elsewhere. |
  | `hugo.toml`        | Hugo, with the GitHub documentation mappings.                                 |
  | `quarto.toml`      | Quarto, with the GitHub documentation mappings.                               |
  | `rmarkdown.toml`   | R Markdown, with the GitHub documentation mappings.                           |
  | `pandoc.toml`      | Pandoc, with the GitHub documentation mappings.                               |

`github-docs.toml` maps READMEs, contributing guides, and other conventional
repository documentation to GFM. The other fallbacks extend it so a GitHub
README does not inherit the site's Markdown flavor.

## Repository audit

The initial manifest records the build files inspected in all 40 upstream
repositories on October 15, 2026. Quarto projects declare `_quarto.yml`;
bookdown projects declare their output formats in `_output.yml`; Hugo projects
configure Hugo and Goldmark. These declarations determine fallback selection.
The comments beside each repository identify the evidence and any upstream
Panache config.

The GitLab `umwelt-info/website` repository currently declares
`flavor = "commonmark"` in its own `panache.toml`, so CommonMark takes
precedence over its Hugo fallback. Likewise, `math-ku/compstat` declares GFM
despite using Quarto to build the site. The scanner preserves both choices.

`rdpeng/rprogdatascience` uses knitr to produce a Leanpub manuscript. Panache
has no dedicated Leanpub flavor, so its manuscript keeps the built-in defaults
while its GitHub documentation receives the GFM mappings.

## Local runs and tests

Run from the Panache repository root with Python 3.11 or newer and fresh output
directories:

```bash
cargo build
python3 .github/smoke-test/scan.py \
    --panache-bin target/debug/panache \
    --results-dir "$(mktemp -d)" \
    --repos-dir "$(mktemp -d)"
```

Use `--manifest` to select a smaller manifest for a local investigation. Its
fallback configs must live in the adjacent `configs/` directory.

The scanner records regressions in `failures.tsv` and leaves the exit-status
decision to the workflow's issue job. It classifies failures from Panache's
diagnostic lines so words in document diffs do not create extra failure records.
Git or process-launch errors abort the scan. Upstream checkouts stay outside the
results directory. The uploaded results contain diagnostics, pass dumps,
fallback configs, and reproduction scripts.

Issue bodies and follow-up comments include the reproduction script for a sample
file. Run it from the extracted `debug-format-repo-scan-results` artifact
directory. It checks out the recorded upstream commit and uses the archived
fallback, including `--config` when the scan had to bypass an invalid upstream
config.

Run the offline scanner tests with:

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s .github/smoke-test
```

The Linux build-and-test job also runs these tests.
